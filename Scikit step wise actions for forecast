Using Scikit-learn, you can build and evaluate machine learning models for predictive modeling and risk assessment.

Data Preprocessing:

Normalize features, handle categorical variables, and split the data into training and testing sets.


Build Machine Learning Models:

Train machine learning models like random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks.



Evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation and tune hyperparameters for better results.
