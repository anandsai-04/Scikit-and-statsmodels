1. Data Preparation
Before you can build any models, you'll need to gather and preprocess your data. This usually involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming variables as needed.

Gather Data: Collect historical insurance data, including claim amounts, policyholder information, and other relevant variables.

Clean Data: Handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the data.

Feature Engineering: Create new features that might be useful for your models, such as interaction terms or aggregate statistics.

2.Statistical Analysis with Statsmodels
Using Statsmodels, you can perform exploratory data analysis, build statistical models, and conduct hypothesis testing.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize distributions, correlations, and trends in the data.

Use pandas and matplotlib for EDA.


Build Statistical Models:

Fit a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) for insurance pricing.
